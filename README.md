### Problem

Users of Hexlet (students) struggle to keep up with their studying schedules
For example, according to the inner research,  numerous students forget about their tasks.
In order to help the students achieve their goals, I decided to create the task-management web-service (service) to create and follow  tasks.

- Registered users should be able to do as everyone else and also create tasks, categorise them (tag them)

## Design
- The service should have dekstop and mobile versions
- The service HTML templates should not include scripts and CSS, but only HTML5 and Bootstrap5
- The language of the service should be English
- The footer of each page of the service should include link to the Hexlet: https://hexlet.io

## Other
